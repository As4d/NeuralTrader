# Python Trading Bot\n\nThis is a Python web app trading bot that I created using machine learning to automatically make trades for profit. The bot is built using Python neural network modules and runs on a Microsoft Azure web app.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use this trading bot, you will need to have Python and Flask installed on your machine. You can install them using the following commands:\n\n\npip install flask\n\n\nYou will also need to install the required Python libraries by running the following command:\n\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use the trading bot, you will need to start the Flask development server by running the following command:\n\n\npython app.py\n\n\nThis will start the server and make the app accessible at http://localhost:5000/.\n\nOnce the server is running, you can access the trading bot by navigating to the app's URL in your web browser. The bot will automatically make trades based on the machine learning model that I built into the app.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAs this is a solo project, I am not accepting contributions from others.
